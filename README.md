Reshade Preset for Planetary Annihilation Titans
To Install just simply download this zip/rar file and extract it to your Planetary Annihilation Titans/bin_x64 folder. Install opengl32.dll (This is usually auto generatored with the Reshader.exe) also into your bin_x64 folder and edit the opengl32.ini file in order for the shader to path correctly to your game. 
example; this line TextureSearchPaths=E:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Planetary Annihilation Titans\bin_x64\reshade-shaders\Textures
might need to be changed to C:\ depending on where your game is installed.
